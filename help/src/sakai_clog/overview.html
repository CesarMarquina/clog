<h1>Clog User Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Clog (Collaborative Log) allows members of Sakai worksites to post entries to a worksite log. The default
view of the tool shows the posts of all the worksite members, chronologically ordered, and this reflects the 
primary supporting use case of the tool as a collaborative logging tool. In a worksite, Clog can also be used
as a more conventional blogging tool in that you can select a particular author from a list and view only their
posts. Clog also supports use from a user's My Workspace where he/she can work on a private, personal log or make
their posts public, whereupon they will be visible in to anybody in the world from a Gateway placement of the tool.</p>
